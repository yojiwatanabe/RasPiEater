# RasPiEater
Tired of insecure Raspberry Pi machines putting your network at risk? Me too! Let's eat some Pis! With the ever-increasing number of internet-connected devices, malicious actors have a wider attack surface for penetrating your network. Insecure Raspberry Pis are an easy way for malicious actors to gain access to a machine on your network.
RasPiEater can beat malicious actors to devices you are aware of (via firewall, router logs, public source) as well as just knock off any insecure Pis on your private network! Don't be bothered by your IDS or firewall due to random Pis on your network beaconing to unknown IPs!

### Currently Tested:
- Single address engagement
  - Knock out a single RasPi by providing its address

### Note:
- Requires some Linux insides knowledge OR a fresh OS to reverse the bite taken by RasPiEater
- Data may be lost on the target RasPi
- Only to be used on machines with explicit permission
